Professional Profile for the bootcamp challenge 2. 


## Description
This challenge is to understand and practice CSS coding and to practice building a professional profile with the advance CSS lessons. 

I performed a web page development for a profile utilizing CSS code. I learned the importance of continous practice with CSS code in order to develop the muscle memory required for a flushed out web page aesthetics, I will need to continue to work on this page as I do not beleive it is complete and will work with my educators and tutors on this specific repo.
